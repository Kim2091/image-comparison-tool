You can compare your images without needing to upload them. This tool is able to:
- Compare images with a slider
- Compare images with a switch (Use your arrow keys)
- Display the differences between two images
- Save a full resolution comparison for you to share

Currently there is no dark theme. Use DarkReader if you want that
